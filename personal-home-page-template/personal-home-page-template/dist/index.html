       <p  class="c-paragragh">
My name is BAHAREH BAZARGAN.I am 37 years old.I am married.I have a 9 year old daugher.Her name is BARAN which means spring in english.
I have just arrived a year ago in the UK.When I arrived here all stores were closed an there was a lockdown ,because of corona virus.
I come from Iran.Iran is a big and beautiful country that is  located  in middleeast with having long history and also tradition monuments and buldings which are made thousands  
 years ago.Various food are cooking in my country which have been known all over the world such as ASH,HALIM,KEBAB and many others dishes.My favorite food is MIRZA  which
 is very popular in north of iran .It is so delicious and tasty.

England is very fantastic country for the pople who wants to improved knowledge and  being succesfull, in the other hands the country with geat opportunities .The only  things that
I dont like just the weather which is always cloudy and rainy.
I live in Hyde a town near ashton which has wonderful nature and sights.Our home is near green hill in mottram thai is so quite and calm,therefore it  causes everybody calm down.
I wake up at seven oclock in the morning and after making breakfast for my family,I drop off my daughter to school and then doing my other stuff.

I look like my sisters but they are not as  tall as me.I am 180 cm so  I used to play basketball in my city" s team.
 I have a good personility ,kind and calm  but I am short tempered.I have short brown hair and black eyes.
 
When I was at my country,Iran,I had studied computer science at Kerman university before I worked at the company which state livestock affairs logistics that affiliated with the ministry of jihad-e-agriculture for about 12 years.I realy liked my job.Nowadays I am trying to find a suitable job for myself I hope it will happen for me ,but first in my opinion I should study and do courses,so I decided to go to collage to reach my goals.

I think if we have a specific goal we should try and making our maximum effort to achive it .Without any effort we can not  reach our desires.Tecnologies and sciences are growing every moments and we have to update ourselves with it.

 Totally I realy happy to live in this country although I have many problems and special situation ,but times goes easily and we just do our best in life.</p>

I am a highly employable individual who is looking forward to re-entering employment, working to the benefit of an employer. I am seeking a role that would enable me to utilise my strengths. My attributes have been recognised by previous employers as I have been given additional responsibilities and I take great pride in my work and achievements. I am people orientated and value the relationships I build up with other members of staff. I would welcome the opportunity to complete further training if required as I am keen to develop my skills and knowledge.
